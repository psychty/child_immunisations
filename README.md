Population vaccination coverage is the best indicator of the level of protection a population will have against vaccine preventable communicable diseases and coverage is highly correlated with levels of disease. As such, keeping a close eye on changes in vaccination coverage helps to identify possible drops in immunity before levels of disease rise. The minimum recommended coverage for vaccination is 95% of the population.
