    <h1>Coverage of childhood vaccinations</h1>
    <p>This analyses presents the latest available data on the coverage of routine childhood vaccinations (from birth to age 5) in primary care settings in West Sussex. Cover of vaccination evaluated rapidly (COVER) data is provided by the Child Health Information Service (CHIS) providers and is reported in the public domain quarterly and annually.</p>
   
    <p>Annual GP practice as well as local authority aggregated coverage data are presented here for 2019/20, 2020/21 and 2021/22 financial years. Maps show the 2021/22 annual coverage. More recent quarterly data for quarters 1 and 2 in 2022/23 (April to June and July to September 2022) are also presented to give early insight into practices that may have low coverage, although this data is unvalidated and subject to revision.</p>
    
    <p>Data collections are quality assured at the time of collection by UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and further validation is carried out by NHS Digital prior to publication (detailed here - https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/nhs-immunisation-statistics/england---2020-21/appendices)</p>

    <p>Importantly, the GP data are <b>experimental</b> and should be treated with caution. It is not an official statistic. Practices with fewer than five eligible patients in a release of data are suppressed. Changes to geographies (such as GP practice closures, mergers, new sites and changes to PCNs) can also impact on estimates.</p>

    <!-- <p>Due to suppression of small counts, data was not available for a small number of GP Practices - estimated annual coverage is not presented at GP practice level in these cases. At PCN and West Sussex level, all available GP practice data was aggregated to the appropriate geography. <b>Numerators and denominators therefore do not reflect the entire eligible cohort in cases where GP practice level data was incomplete</b>. </p> -->

      <h3>Good to know...</h3>
    <p>There are sometimes changes to the vaccinations offered.</p>
    <p>The DTaP/IPV/Hib (5-in-1) vaccine was replaced by the DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB (6-in-1) vaccine in August 2017. Therefore the 24 month age cohort in 2019/20 (born in 2017/18), will have received either the 5-in-1 or the 6-in-1 vaccination, depending on when in the year they were vaccinated. From 2020/21 onwards, all children in the 12 month cohort were eligible for the DtaP/IPV/Hib/HepB (6-in-1) vaccination.</p>
    <p>Finally, disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have caused some decreases in vaccine coverage, particularly for the 12 month and 24 month cohorts.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Coverage of immunisations; 12 months</h3>
    <h4>Schedule:</h4>
    <p>Children who reached their first birthday in the time period are scheduled to receive their third combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B vaccine (known as DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB or hexavalent vaccine), PCV, MenB and rotavirus vaccines. With the exception of rotavirus vaccine which is only offered up to 6 months of age, all other vaccines are available to children in the current cohort at any time.</p>

    <h4>Table - West Sussex annual coverage; 2019/20 to 2021/22; 12 month olds</h4>

    <p>The map for age 12 months shows circles for DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB vaccine, Men B, PCV dose 1, and Rotavirus for each GP practice coloured by coverage verses benchmark targets (red for less than 90%, amber for 90-95%, green for 95+% (denoted as low/medium/high coverage respectively), with a grey circle for those which could not be calculated); this is either because the practice has no eligible children at this time. Where the number of eligible children is less than five, the denominator is supressed even if the proportion is given.</p>

    <h3>Coverage of immunisations; 24 months</h3>
    <h4>Schedule:</h4>
    <p>Children who reached their second birthday in the time period were scheduled to receive their third DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB, MenB and rotavirus vaccinations, and their first measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination, a booster dose of Hib and MenC (given as a combined Hib/MenC vaccine), MenB and PCV vaccines at the same visit from 12 months of age. With the exception of rotavirus vaccine which is only offered up to 6 months of age, all other vaccines are available to children in this cohort at any time.</p>
  
    <p>The map for age 24 months shows circles for DTaP/IPV/Hib vaccine, MMR (dose 1) vaccine, Hib/Men C vaccine, PCV booster, and Men B booster for each GP practice coloured by coverage verses benchmark targets (red for less than 90%, amber for 90-95%, green for 95+% (denoted as low/medium/high coverage respectively), with a grey circle for those which could not be calculated).</p>
    <div id = 'map_24_months_id'></div>
    
    <h4>Coverage of immunisations; 2021/22; 5 year olds</h4>
    <h4>Schedule:</h4>
    <p>Children who reached their fifth birthday in the time period were scheduled to receive their third dose DTaP/IPV/Hib and second PCV and one MenB vaccination. They were also scheduled to receive their first MMR, Hib/MenC booster and PCV booster after their first birthday, and their pre-school diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated polio booster (DTaP/IPV) and second dose MMR. DTaP/IPV/Hib, first and second doses of MMR, and DTaP/IPV would have been captured in this report if given by their fifth birthday.</p>
    <p>The map for age 5 shows circles for MMR (dose 1) vaccine, MMR (dose 2) vaccine, DTaP/IPV vaccine, DTaP/IPV/Hib vaccine, and Hib/Men C vaccine for each GP practice coloured by coverage verses benchmark targets (red for less than 90%, amber for 90-95%, green for 95+% (denoted as low/medium/high coverage respectively), with a grey circle for those which could not be calculated).</p>
