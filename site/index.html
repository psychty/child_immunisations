    <h1>Coverage of childhood vaccinations</h1>
    <p>This analyses presents data on the coverage of routine childhood vaccinations (from birth to age 5) in primary care settings in West Sussex. Cover of vaccination evaluated rapidly (COVER) data is provided by the Child Health Information Service (CHIS) providers and is reported in the public domain quarterly and annually.</p>

    <p>Annual data at local authority level is by NHS Digital and is reproduced on fingertips. Data collections are quality assured at the time of collection by UKHSA and further validation is carried out by NHS Digital prior to publication (detailed here - https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/nhs-immunisation-statistics/england---2020-21/appendices)</p>
    
    <p>In 2019/20, Public Health England (PHE) published annual GP data (previously published by NHS England). This was the first year where annual GP practice level coverage was based on a refreshed extract, which allowed for corrections to be made following quarterly submissions. This data is also aggregated in the National General Practice Profiles on Fingertips, although there is a time lag.</p>

    <p>However, the GP data are <b>experimental</b> and should be treated with caution. It is not an official statistic.</p>
    <p>Practices with fewer than 5 patients in quarterly release of data are suppressed. This means that aggregated data (over time, or by geography) may not fully capture coverage for all eligible children. Chianges to geographies (such as GP practice closures, mergers, new sites and changes to PCNs) can also impact on estimates.</p>

    <p>Annual GP practice level coverage data has also been published for 2020/21. Where possible, published annual data has been presented from published sources (as oppoesed to aggregated data from quarterly releases). However, due to a lag in the release of annual data, coverage has been estimated from quarterly releases on some occasion.</p>

    <p>Due to suppression of small counts, data was not available for a small number of GP Practices - estimated annual coverage is not presented at GP practice level in these cases. At PCN and West Sussex level, all available GP practice data was aggregated to the appropriate geography. <b>Numerators and denominators therefore do not reflect the entire eligible cohort in cases where GP practice level data was incomplete</b>. Recent quarterly data is also presented to give early insight into practices that may have low coverage, although this data is unvalidated.</p>

    <p>Finally, disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have caused some decreases in vaccine coverage, particularly for the 12 month cohort.</p>

    <h3>Coverage immunisations; 2021/22; 12 month olds</h3>
    <h4>Schedule:</h4>
    <p>Children who reached their first birthday in the quarter are scheduled to receive their third combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B vaccine (known as DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB or hexavalent vaccine), PCV, MenB and rotavirus vaccines. With the exception of rotavirus vaccine which is only offered up to 6 months of age, all other vaccines are available to children in the current cohort at any time.</p>

    <h4>Table - Local authority level coverage; 2021/22; 12 month olds</h4>

    <p>The leaflet map for age 12 months shows circles for DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB vaccine, Men B, PCV dose 1, and Rotavirus for each GP practice coloured by coverage verses benchmark targets (red for less than 90%, amber for 90-95%, green for 95+% (denoted as low/medium/high coverage respectively), with a grey circle for those which could not be calculated).</p>

    <h3>Coverage immunisations; 2021/22; 24 month olds</h3>
    <h4>Schedule:</h4>
    <p>Children who reached their second birthday in the quarter were scheduled to receive their third DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB, MenB and rotavirus vaccinations, and their first measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination, a booster dose of Hib and MenC (given as a combined Hib/MenC vaccine), MenB and PCV vaccines at the same visit from 12 months of age. With the exception of rotavirus vaccine which is only offered up to 6 months of age, all other vaccines are available to children in this cohort at any time.</p>
    <p>The map for age 24 months shows circles for DTaP/IPV/Hib vaccine, MMR (dose 1) vaccine, Hib/Men C vaccine, PCV booster, and Men B booster for each GP practice coloured by coverage verses benchmark targets (red for less than 90%, amber for 90-95%, green for 95+% (denoted as low/medium/high coverage respectively), with a grey circle for those which could not be calculated).</p>
    <div id = 'map_24_months_id'></div>
    
    <h4>Coverage immunisations; 2021/22; 5 year olds</h4>
    <h4>Schedule:</h4>
    <p>Children who reached their fifth birthday in the quarter were scheduled to receive their third dose DTaP/IPV/Hib and second PCV and one MenB vaccination. They were also scheduled to receive their first MMR, Hib/MenC booster and PCV booster after their first birthday, and their pre-school diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated polio booster (DTaP/IPV) and second dose MMR. DTaP/IPV/Hib, first and second doses of MMR, and DTaP/IPV would have been captured in this report if given by their fifth birthday.</p>
    <p>The map for age 5 shows circles for MMR (dose 1) vaccine, MMR (dose 2) vaccine, DTaP/IPV vaccine, DTaP/IPV/Hib vaccine, and Hib/Men C vaccine for each GP practice coloured by coverage verses benchmark targets (red for less than 90%, amber for 90-95%, green for 95+% (denoted as low/medium/high coverage respectively), with a grey circle for those which could not be calculated).</p>
